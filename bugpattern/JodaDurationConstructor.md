## The problem
Joda-Time's 'new Duration(long)' constructor is ambiguous with respect to time units and is frequently a source of bugs. Please use Duration.millis(long) instead. If your Duration is better expressed in terms of other units, use standardSeconds(long), standardMinutes(long), standardHours(long), or standardDays(long) instead.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("JodaDurationConstructor")` to the enclosing element.
